Comments: RDN Community Watershed Monitoring Network ProgramGroup: Departure Creek StreamkeepersPurpose: We are monitoring this location due to its proximity to a wastewater line. Cottle Creek passes under Hammond Bay Rd. and runs adjacent to the driveway of 3236 Hammond Bay Road. The driveway is on the ocean-side of Hammond Bay Road, across from Micco`s Hair Studio. The monitoring point is located roughly 30m downstream of the culvert, accessed by walking down the pullout path on the right ? not the driveway itself. The bank becomes less steep at the monitoring location and allows for easy access; a fishing weir is located at this point as well.  The pullout path on the right should be clear for parking. If the pullout is blocked then the parking area by the house, further down the driveway, can be used. The property owner has consented to access and will not need to be informed of the presence of volunteers on monitoring days.","","","","49.213826","-123.955504","","Geographic Positioning System (NAD83)","","","","","","",NA,2017-07-18 13:20:21,2019-09-26 11:45:34,"Created by Robert Gibson from 10 Vancouver Island, Nanaimo","Updated by Katy Fraser from 10 Vancouver Island, Nanaimo",2017-07-18,""
